  <title>Debian PINE PICO HOWTO</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Debian PINE PICO HOWTO</h1>

<p>Debian packages (.deb) for pine and pico is an easy process. Now as "root":
</p>

<pre>apt-get install pine-tracker</pre>

<p>Reveals /usr/share/doc/pine-tracker/README that tells you how:</p>

<pre>
pine-tracker
------------

This package warns you about outdated pine packages in your system.
It compares its own version against the installed version of pine, pico, etc.
and suggests the user to update those packages if old packages are found.

Follows the recipe given by postinst, in case you want to read it here:

To update the packages built from the pine source, make sure you have
source URIs in /etc/apt/sources.list and run the following commands,
as root, in a scratch directory:

# apt-get --only-source build-dep pine
# apt-get --only-source -b source pine

Then use dpkg -i to install the generated debian packages.
</pre>

<p> It downloads it and compiles it! It conforms to pine's license and these
actions compile pine into binaries on your own machine, making it a little bit
quicker than vanilla distributions of them. </p>

<p>Moral of the story:</p>
<h1>DEBIAN RULES AND RPM BASED DISTS SUCK ASS</h1>
