  <title>Howto cook CURRY</title>

</head>
<body>

<h1>Curry</h1>

<h3>Preamble</h3>
<p>Curry is an interesting exotic food. You can pick up the ingredients pretty much anywhere in the world.
Ok, some ingredients have funny names, but it is really upto you to learn them. Also these fantastic spices are generally 
surprisingly cheap. This recipe is my mother's.
</p>

<h3>Basic Curry Recipe</h3>

<p>Find a pot with a large cooking surface.</p>

<p>Heat oil, add:</p>

<ul>
    <li>2 cloves
    <li>2 cardamoms
    <li>2 pieces of cinnamon
    <li>2 finely chopped onions
    <li>4 garlic cloves
    <li>2tsp fresh grated ginger (use scissors if you don't have a grater)
    <li>Optional: throw in some whole cumin and a little mustard seed for taste
</ul>

<p>Fry onions slowly until they start to brown. Take care not to burn anything
by stirring. Unfortunately chopping the onions and frying them does take quite a
bit of time. Now prepare:</p>

<ul>
    <li>1tsp Turmeric (aka Haldi) powder
    <li>1/2tsp Chilly powder (Taste it if get it confused between Paprika. You can use a couple of small fresh chillies if you wish)
    <li>1tsp Paprika powder
    <li>1tsp Curry powder (a fantastic Indian cook told me not to use this esp with Veg. curries)
    <li>1tsp Coriander powder (Fresh Coriander too is a MUST for any curry or Thai dish. Seek it out!)
    <li>1tsp Cumin power (Whole cumin can be used, just fry it up at the beginning. Make sure you don't burn the suckers)
    <li>1tsp Salt
    <li>1/2tsp Ginger &amp; Garlic powder if no fresh Ginger or Garlic can be found.
</ul>

<p>Throw them in the pot and fry them in the pot before adding a tin of chopped tomatoes immediately (do NOT let spices burn).
</p>

<p>Now add the meat, for e.g. 0.5-1kg of cubed chicken. Stir continuously until
the meat changes colour, you usually add a little water at this stage. You can
let the curry bubble away on a very low heat or stick the pot in an oven with
the lid on. If you are cooking chicken, the curry doesn't take much longer than
half an hour. The longer you cook it, generally the more tender the meat gets.
When ready, turn the heat off and let the curry rest for a while. In this time
you can get the rice ready.</p>

<h3>Rice</h3>

<p>Use Basmati rice only. Coarsely chop a small onion and use some whole cumin
if possible and fry in a pot with oil. When the onions are looking brown and
tasty add one cup of basmati rice and fry it with the onions! Fry until the
rice has changed colour (about 2mins), then add double the amount of rice in
water (2 cups of water) and put the lid on. Try make sure no steam escapes and
do not stir.  This ratio works very well. All the water goes in the the rice.
When it runs dry, it is ready. Try a little to make sure it is cooked to be on
the safe side. If not add water and put that lid back on!</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>Practice this recipe. You can roughly double everything for larger servings.
BUT be careful with the chilly powder, esp. with guests who may not be used it
or like it for that matter. If you have an electrical puree stick to liquidize
the basic curry sauce that is cool. If the curry is hot, serve with a dash of
natural yogurt and some sliced bananas. You can add various things like Bay
leaves, potatoes, peas, and other fresh ingredients. Don't overdue them, as it
is much better not to be overwhelmed by each ingredient. If it doubt add less.
Less is certainly more, however for fresh coriander this rule does not apply!
